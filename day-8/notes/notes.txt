Type Conversion built in functions:
type conversion is converting one datatype into another datatype.
Some of the type conversion built in functions are :
=>
 int()
 float()
 str()
 bool()
 f-strings()

==========

Mathematical Built in functions:
used to perform number related operations.
=>

round()
max()
min()
pow()
divmod()
abs()

=========

type and print built in functions:

type()
used to find the datatype of a value or variables

print()
used to display output on screen

==========

input built in functions:

input() is a method which is used to read the data from user at run time of our program.
Always the input function returns you string data type value.
It is your responsibility to convert string data type to any other format.
For conversting one data type to other, we are going to use type conversion methods.

Example: 
for converting to int datatype => int({value})
float => float({value})
str => str({value})
bool => bool({value})


Example Program:

def addition(i, j):
    print("i + j = ", i + j)

k_str = input("Enter values : ")
h_str = input()

k_int = int(k_str)
h_int = int(h_str)
addition(k_int, h_int)
