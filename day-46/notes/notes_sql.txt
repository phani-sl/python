What is SELECT?
SELECT is an SQL (Structured Query Language) statement used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.
It allows you to fetch specific columns or all columns, apply conditions, sort results, and even combine data from multiple tables.

Ways to Fetch Data from a Table
(a) Fetch all data
SELECT * FROM employees;
➡ Retrieves all rows and columns from the employees table.

(b) Fetch specific columns
SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees;
➡ Retrieves only the first_name and salary columns.

(c) Fetch with condition (WHERE clause)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
➡ Retrieves rows where salary is greater than 50,000


If you want to fetch only the desired (specific) columns from a table, you simply list those column names in the SELECT statement instead of using *.
Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name;

Example

Suppose you have a table called employees with the following columns:
id, first_name, last_name, department, salary, hire_date

Fetch only first name and salary
SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees;


Fetch only department and hire_date
SELECT department, hire_dateFROM employees;


Fetch id, first_name, and last_name of employees in IT department

SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';


What is WHERE clause in SQL?
The WHERE clause is used in SQL to filter rows from a table based on a condition.
It tells the database which rows should be retrieved (or updated, deleted) and which should not.
Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;


What are AND and OR in SQL?
They are logical operators used inside the WHERE clause (or in conditions) to combine multiple conditions.
AND → All conditions must be true.
OR → At least one condition must be true.
