1. What is ThreadPoolExecutor? What is the use of it. Write multiple examples on this. 

What is ThreadPoolExecutor?
ThreadPoolExecutor is a class in Pythonâ€™s concurrent.futures module that provides a high-level interface for managing threads.
Instead of manually creating and managing threads, you can use ThreadPoolExecutor to submit tasks (functions) that run in parallel.
It manages a pool of worker threads and reuses them, which makes it efficient compared to creating a new thread for every task.

Uses:
Simplifies multithreading (no need to create and manage threads manually).
Efficient resource use (reuses threads instead of creating new ones every time).
Supports asynchronous execution (you can submit tasks and check results later).
Scales well when you have many small tasks (like network requests, file I/O).
