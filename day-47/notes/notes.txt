What is SELECT?
SELECT is an SQL (Structured Query Language) statement used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.
It allows you to fetch specific columns or all columns, apply conditions, sort results, and even combine data from multiple tables.

Ways to Fetch Data from a Table
(a) Fetch all data
SELECT * FROM employees;
➡ Retrieves all rows and columns from the employees table.

(b) Fetch specific columns
SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees;
➡ Retrieves only the first_name and salary columns.

(c) Fetch with condition (WHERE clause)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
➡ Retrieves rows where salary is greater than 50,000


If you want to fetch only the desired (specific) columns from a table, you simply list those column names in the SELECT statement instead of using *.
Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name;

Example

Suppose you have a table called employees with the following columns:
id, first_name, last_name, department, salary, hire_date

Fetch only first name and salary
SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees;


Fetch only department and hire_date
SELECT department, hire_dateFROM employees;


Fetch id, first_name, and last_name of employees in IT department

SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';


What is WHERE clause in SQL?
The WHERE clause is used in SQL to filter rows from a table based on a condition.
It tells the database which rows should be retrieved (or updated, deleted) and which should not.
Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;


What are AND and OR in SQL?
They are logical operators used inside the WHERE clause (or in conditions) to combine multiple conditions.
AND → All conditions must be true.
OR → At least one condition must be true.


LIKE in SQL
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
It allows pattern matching instead of exact matching.
Wildcard Characters in SQL

When used with LIKE, we usually use these wildcards:

Wildcard	Meaning	Example
%	Represents 0 or more characters	'a%' → any string starting with a
_	Represents exactly one character	'a_' → any string starting with a and one more character

% → 0 or more characters
-- Find employees whose name starts with 'A'
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmpName LIKE 'A%';

-- Find employees whose name ends with 'e'
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmpName LIKE '%e';

-- Find employees whose name contains 'an'
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmpName LIKE '%an%';


_ → exactly one character
-- Find employees whose name is 4 letters long
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmpName LIKE '____';

-- Find employees whose name starts with 'D' and is 5 letters long
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmpName LIKE 'D____';

-- Find employees whose second letter is 'a'
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmpName LIKE '_a%';


If you want to get unique (non-duplicate) values from a column in SQL, you use the DISTINCT keyword.
Syntax:
SELECT DISTINCT column_name 
FROM table_name;

Multiple Columns with DISTINCT
If you want unique combinations of values:
SELECT DISTINCT Department, EmpName
FROM Employees;
