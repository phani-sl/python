1. What is Daemon Thread? How do you create it.

Daemon Thread:
A daemon thread is a thread that runs in the background and stops automatically when the main program exits.
You use it for background tasks like logging, monitoring, or cleanup.


2. What are the differences b/w a normal thread to daemon thread.

Normal Thread:

It performs the main tasks of a program.
The program waits for it to finish before exiting.
It runs until its task is complete, no matter how long it takes.
Created normally:

thread = threading.Thread(target=task)  # default is non-daemon

Daemon Thread:

It runs in the background to perform helper tasks like logging or monitoring.
The program does not wait for it; it stops automatically when all normal threads finish.
It can be terminated abruptly if the main program ends, even if the task is not finished.
Created by setting it as daemon:

thread = threading.Thread(target=task)
thread.daemon = True
