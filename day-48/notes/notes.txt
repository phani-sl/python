What is the NOT operator in SQL?
The NOT operator is used to negate a condition.
It returns records when the condition is FALSE.

Using NOT with LIKE
LIKE is used for pattern matching with wildcards (%, _).
When combined with NOT, it excludes matching patterns.


What is REGEXP in MySQL?
REGEXP (or RLIKE, both same in MySQL) is used for pattern matching using regular expressions.
Unlike LIKE (which only supports % and _), REGEXP supports advanced pattern matching such as character classes, ranges, repetition, anchors, etc.
It returns rows where the column value matches the given regular expression


What is ORDER BY clause?
The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the result set of a query.
Sorting can be done in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
By default, it is ASC (ascending).


Restricting Results in SQL
In SQL, if you don’t want all rows, but only a limited number of rows, you use the LIMIT clause.


What is LIMIT in MySQL?
In MySQL, LIMIT is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query.
Mostly used to display Top N records or to paginate results.
Can be combined with WHERE (filtering) and ORDER BY (sorting)


What is GROUP BY clause?
The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups.
It is mostly used with aggregate functions like:
COUNT() → counts rows
SUM() → adds values
AVG() → average values
MAX() → highest value
MIN() → lowest value    

Why/Where do you use GROUP BY?
You use it when you want summarized results instead of raw rows.

Examples where GROUP BY is useful:
Find number of students per class
Find total salary per department
Find average marks per subject
Find highest sale per region


What are Functions in SQL?
In SQL, functions are predefined operations that perform calculations, transform data, or return specific information.
They take inputs (arguments), process them, and return a result.
Types of SQL Functions
(a) Aggregate Functions → Work on a group of rows and return a single result
COUNT() → counts rows
SUM() → adds values
AVG() → finds average
MAX() → finds highest value
MIN() → finds lowest value

Scalar Functions → Work on individual values and return a single result per row
UPPER() → converts text to uppercase
LOWER() → converts text to lowercase
LENGTH() → returns length of string
ROUND() → rounds a number
NOW() → returns current date & time

Date and Time Functions
NOW() → current date and time
CURDATE() → current date
CURTIME() → current time
YEAR(date), MONTH(date), DAY(date) → extract parts of a date

String Functions
CONCAT(a, b) → joins strings
SUBSTRING(str, start, length) → extracts part of string
TRIM() → removes spaces

Mathematical Functions
ROUND() → rounds a number
FLOOR() → largest integer ≤ value
CEIL() → smallest integer ≥ value
MOD(a, b) → remainder after division

Why do we use Functions in SQL?

To simplify queries (no need to write complex logic manually)
To perform calculations directly in queries
To summarize large data (e.g., totals, averages)
To format data (e.g., uppercase names, formatted dates)
To improve productivity (ready-made formulas save time)
