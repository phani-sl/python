1. Can we catch multiple types of exceptions using single except? if yes how? Write multiple examples on it.
    Yes, we can catch multiple types of exceptions using single except.
    we must use parentheses () to group the exception types.

2. What are the dunder methods. What is the use of them.
    Dunder methods (short for "double underscore methods") are special methods in Python whose names start and 
    end with double underscores.
    Automatically runs when an object is created; sets up initial attributes.
    Control what gets printed when the object is displayed.
    Make your objects work with ==

3. What __init__, __str__, __repr__ and __eq__ methods. Write multiple examples for each one of them with the explaination.
    1. __init__ â€“ Object Initializer
        Called automatically when a new object is created.
        Sets up initial attributes for the object (like a constructor in other languages)
        __init__ runs right after the object is created and stores the provided values in instance variables.

    2. __str__
        Defines what str(obj) should display.
        Gives a readable output.
        Without __str__, Python prints the default memory address.

    3. __repr__
        Returns a string that should describe the object.

    4. __eq__
        Defines how == works between objects.
        Compares object attributes instead of memory addresses.
        Without __eq__, == compares memory addresses, so two objects with same values would still be considered different.
