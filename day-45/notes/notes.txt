1. What is Database? What are the different databases available in the market.

1. What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
It is stored electronically in a computer system and is managed by a Database Management System (DBMS).
A DBMS provides tools to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently.
It ensures data integrity, security, concurrency, and recovery.

Example: A student management system database stores student details, marks, attendance, etc., so they can be queried whenever needed.

2. Different Types of Databases Available in the Market
Databases are categorized into different types, and within each type, there are popular tools/software.
(A) Relational Databases (RDBMS)
Store data in tables (rows and columns).
Use SQL (Structured Query Language).

Examples:
Oracle Database
MySQL
Microsoft SQL Server
PostgreSQL
IBM Db2
MariaDB

(B) NoSQL Databases
Designed for unstructured, semi-structured, and large-scale data.
Flexible schema and high scalability.
Types: Key-Value, Document, Column-based, Graph.

Examples:
MongoDB (Document)
Cassandra (Column)
Redis (Key-Value)
CouchDB (Document)
Neo4j (Graph)
Amazon DynamoDB


2. What are the types of databases. Define them

Types of Databases & Their Definitions
1. Relational Database (RDBMS)
Definition: A relational database stores data in tables (rows and columns). Each row represents a record, and columns represent attributes. Data is accessed using SQL (Structured Query Language).
Examples: Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server.
Use Case: Banking systems, ERP, student management systems.

2. NoSQL Database
Definition: A NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database is designed for unstructured, semi-structured, or large-scale data. It offers flexibility, scalability, and high performance.
Types of NoSQL:
Document-based → MongoDB, CouchDB
Key-Value → Redis, DynamoDB
Column-based → Cassandra, HBase
Graph → Neo4j
Use Case: Social media apps, IoT data, real-time analytics.


3. What is SQL? Why do we need this.

1. What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and interact with databases.
It is mainly used in Relational Databases (RDBMS) like Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server.
SQL allows you to store, retrieve, update, and delete data in databases.
It is also used for schema creation, access control, and transaction management.

Example:

SELECT name, marks FROM Students WHERE marks > 80;
This query retrieves student names and marks of those who scored above 80.

2. Why Do We Need SQL?
We need SQL because:
(A) Data Management
Databases contain huge amounts of data.
SQL provides a systematic and efficient way to manage it.

(B) Easy to Use
SQL uses simple English-like commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Anyone with basic knowledge can learn it quickly.

(C) Standard Language
SQL is a universal standard supported by almost all RDBMS (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).
Learning SQL means you can work with any relational database.

(D) Data Security & Integrity
SQL provides user access control (GRANT, REVOKE).
It maintains data integrity (using constraints like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY).

(E) Handling Big Data
SQL can handle large-scale data efficiently.
Essential for banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and enterprise applications.

(F) Analytics & Reporting
SQL is widely used in data analysis, business intelligence, and reporting tools (like Tableau, Power BI).
Supports aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN).


4. What are different categories of queries available in SQL. Define them.

In SQL, queries are grouped into different categories based on their purpose.
Categories of SQL Queries

1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
Definition: DDL queries are used to define and manage database structures (tables, schemas, indexes).
Commands:
CREATE → create a new database/table
ALTER → modify table structure
DROP → delete table/database
TRUNCATE → delete all records but keep structure

Example:
CREATE TABLE Students (
    RollNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Marks INT
);

2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
Definition: DML queries are used to manipulate (insert, update, delete) data inside tables.
Commands:
INSERT → add new data
UPDATE → modify existing data
DELETE → remove records

Example:
INSERT INTO Students (RollNo, Name, Marks)
VALUES (101, 'Phani', 90);

3. DQL (Data Query Language)
Definition: DQL queries are used to fetch data from a database.
Command:
SELECT → retrieve data from tables

Example:

SELECT Name, Marks FROM Students WHERE Marks > 80;

4. DCL (Data Control Language)
Definition: DCL queries control user access and permissions to the database.
Commands:
GRANT → give access rights
REVOKE → remove access rights

Example:

GRANT SELECT ON Students TO user1;

5. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
Definition: TCL queries manage transactions in a database to ensure consistency and rollback in case of errors.
Commands:
COMMIT → save changes permanently
ROLLBACK → undo changes
SAVEPOINT → create checkpoints within transactions

Example:

BEGIN;
UPDATE Students SET Marks = Marks + 5 WHERE RollNo = 101;
COMMIT;


5. Install PostgreSQL and MySQL also.
