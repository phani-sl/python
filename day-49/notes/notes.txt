1. What is group by cluase? Where do you use them.
The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups.
It is usually combined with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), or MIN() to perform calculations on each group of data.
Definition:
GROUP BY groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
Where do we use GROUP BY?
When you want to summarize data.
When you need to calculate totals, averages, counts, etc. for groups.
Used in reports, analytics, and data summaries.


2. What are functions in sql? How and why do you use them. 
What are Functions in SQL?
In SQL, functions are predefined (built-in) operations that take input (arguments), perform a task, and return a single value or result.
They are used to manipulate data, perform calculations, format values, and extract useful information.

Types of SQL Functions
1. Aggregate Functions
Work on a set of rows and return a single result.
Examples:
COUNT() → counts rows
SUM() → adds values
AVG() → average
MAX() → maximum value
MIN() → minimum value
2. Scalar Functions
Work on each row individually and return a single value per row.
Examples:
String functions → UPPER(), LOWER(), LENGTH(), CONCAT()
Numeric functions → ROUND(), ABS(), POWER()
Date functions → NOW(), CURDATE(), MONTH(), YEAR()

Why do we use them?
To simplify calculations (e.g., total sales = SUM(amount)).
To format data (e.g., make names uppercase).
To analyze data (e.g., average marks, count of employees per department).
To manipulate strings/dates easily.
