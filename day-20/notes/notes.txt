pass statement
pass statement does nothing. it skips future code.
example:

x = 5
if x > 3:
    pass


for i in range(1, 5):
    pass


def addition(a, b):
    pass



do-while loop
in python there is no built in do while loop. but we can create do while loop using while loop true and break statement
do while loop run atleast once
checks condition at end of the loop
syntax:
while True:
    block of code
    if not condition:
    break 

example:
i = 1
while True:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i > 5:
        break
